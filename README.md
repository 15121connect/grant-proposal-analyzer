# 🎯 Grant Proposal Analyzer

An intelligent web application that matches project proposals with relevant grant opportunities using AI-powered analysis and semantic matching.

![Demo Screenshot](docs/screenshots/demo_screenshot.png)

## 🌟 Features

- **Smart Matching Algorithm**: Analyzes project descriptions against grant criteria

- **Real-time Analysis**: Instant feedback on grant alignment strength

- **Visual Strength Meters**: Color-coded indicators (High/Medium/Low match)

- **Comprehensive Grant Database**: Pre-loaded with diverse funding opportunities

- **Clean Two-Panel Interface**: Intuitive input/output design

- **Detailed Grant Information**: Focus areas, funding amounts, deadlines, requirements, and contact details

- **File Upload Support**: Upload up to 3 proposal documents (PDF, DOCX, images, text) for better analysis.

- **LLM Integration**: Enhanced proposal analysis using Large Language Models (LLM) API integration.

- **Share Functionality**: Generate shareable links to share your analysis results with collaborators.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18

- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS

- **Icons**: Lucide React

- **Build Tool**: Create React App / Vite

- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages / Netlify

## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)

- npm or yarn

### Setup

```bash

# Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/15121connect/grant-proposal-analyzer.git

# Navigate to project directory

cd grant-proposal-analyzer

# Install dependencies

npm install

# Start development server

npm start

```

The application will open at `http://localhost:3000`

### Testing with Sample Data

A sample grant proposal PDF is included in the `resources/` folder for testing:

- **Sample File**: `resources/sample-grant-proposal.pdf` - Arctic Community Microgrid Initiative

You can upload this file using the file upload feature to test the application's document analysis capabilities.

## 🎮 Usage

1. **Enter Project Description**: Type or paste your project details in the left panel

   - Include key information: goals, methodology, target community, expected outcomes

   - More detail = better matching accuracy

2. **Upload Files (Optional)**: Click the plus (+) button to upload supporting documents

   - Upload up to 3 files (PDF, DOCX, images, text files)

   - Maximum total file size: 5MB

   - File content will be automatically extracted and included in the analysis

   - View file thumbnails and remove files as needed

3. **Analyze**: Click the "Analyze" button to process your proposal

4. **Review Results**: View matched grants sorted by alignment strength

   - Green (70%+): Strong match

   - Yellow (40-69%): Moderate match  

   - Red (<40%): Weak match

5. **Explore Grants**: Click on any grant card to expand and see full details including website and contact information

6. **Share Results**: Click the share icon next to the match count to generate a shareable link with your analysis results

## 📊 How It Works

The matching algorithm evaluates proposals across multiple dimensions:

- **Keyword Matching** (15 points per match): Technical and domain keywords

- **Focus Area Alignment** (20 points per match): Primary grant objectives

- **Requirement Coverage** (10 points per requirement): Proposal completeness

- **Detail Bonus** (up to 10 points): Length and depth of description

Maximum score: 100 points

See [METHODOLOGY.md](docs/METHODOLOGY.md) for detailed scoring logic.

## 🔧 Configuration

### Adding New Grants

Edit `src/data/grantsDatabase.js`:

```javascript

{

  id: 7,

  name: "Your Grant Name",

  funder: "Organization Name",

  amount: "$X - $Y",

  deadline: "YYYY-MM-DD",

  focus: ["area1", "area2"],

  keywords: ["keyword1", "keyword2"],

  requirements: ["req1", "req2"]

}

```

### Customizing Scoring

Modify weights in `src/utils/matchingAlgorithm.js`:

```javascript

const WEIGHTS = {

  KEYWORD_MATCH: 15,

  FOCUS_MATCH: 20,

  REQUIREMENT_MATCH: 10,

  DETAIL_BONUS: 5

};

```

### LLM API Configuration

To enable LLM-enhanced analysis, create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env

REACT_APP_LLM_API_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions

REACT_APP_LLM_API_KEY=your-api-key-here

```

The application will automatically use LLM enhancement when files are uploaded. If no API key is configured, the system falls back to basic text matching.

## 🚧 Roadmap
