# Usage Guide

## Getting Started

### Basic Workflow

1. **Prepare Your Proposal**

   - Draft a clear project description (200-500 words recommended)

   - Include: problem, solution, methodology, impact, timeline

   - Mention specific technologies, communities, or outcomes

2. **Input Your Project**

   - Paste or type description in left panel

   - Character count displayed at bottom

   - No maximum length, but detail improves matching

3. **Analyze**

   - Click "Analyze" button

   - Wait 1-2 seconds for processing

   - Results appear ranked by alignment

4. **Review Results**

   - Top matches appear first

   - Check strength meter for quick assessment

   - Read matching themes and requirements

### Example Input

```
We're developing a solar-powered water purification system for rural 
indigenous communities in Northern Canada. The project combines renewable 
energy with community-led water management, creating local jobs while 
ensuring clean water access. We have partnerships with three First Nations 
communities and plan to pilot the system over 18 months with comprehensive 
impact evaluation. The technology uses photovoltaic panels and advanced 
filtration, with a goal of providing clean water to 500 households. Our 
approach emphasizes community ownership, traditional knowledge integration, 
and sustainable maintenance models.
```

### Interpreting Results

**Strong Match (70-100%)**

- Multiple keyword and theme matches

- High alignment with grant objectives

- Proceed with full application

**Moderate Match (40-69%)**

- Some alignment, but gaps exist

- Consider adapting proposal emphasis

- Review requirements carefully

**Weak Match (<40%)**

- Limited alignment

- May not be worth pursuing

- Look for more suitable grants

## Tips for Better Matches

1. **Be Specific**: Include concrete details about technology, methodology, and impact

2. **Use Keywords**: Incorporate domain-specific terminology

3. **Show Readiness**: Mention partnerships, feasibility studies, or pilot plans

4. **Quantify Impact**: Include numbers (people served, carbon reduced, etc.)

5. **Address Requirements**: Reference evaluation, scalability, sustainability

## Troubleshooting

**No good matches?**

- Try broader keywords

- Check if your project fits grant categories in database

- Consider expanding project scope description

**All matches seem irrelevant?**

- Your project may be outside current grant database

- Contact admin to suggest adding relevant grant types

**Results seem inaccurate?**

- Algorithm uses keyword matching, not semantic understanding

- Future versions will integrate LLM analysis

- Provide feedback to improve scoring
